      <Label title="6 · Beside, with a short and a long body">
        The head is static and top-aligned, so with a one-sentence body the head is the taller
        column and the band ends under the head; with a long body the head sits at the top of a
        column that is mostly air. Neither is corrected — a sticking head is ruling O2&rsquo;s
        rejected option, and stretching the head would put the lead at the band&rsquo;s foot.
        The long body mixes prose, icon cards two across and rows — what a beside body may hold
        (§ 1.4 rule 5); never a three-up set.

      <Label title="7 · Absent slots, and how beside degrades">
        Each head slot renders no element and no seam when absent — an empty string counts as
        absent. Without an eyebrow the heading is the head&rsquo;s first row; without a lead the
        eyebrow and heading are the whole head; a lead alone is a valid head. Beside needs both
        halves, a head and BLOCKS: with no head the blocks take the full column, and with no
        blocks the head does — both are the stacked band exactly, because an empty third or an
        empty two-thirds is a hole. A degraded band has no head track, so an aside is dropped
        rather than set full column (a 3:2 photo at 1240 is ~827 tall and would be upscaled from
        the 381 file). An empty children array counts as no blocks, so no 48 seam hangs under
        the head. These are degrade cases, not page shapes.

        actionsAt=&quot;end&quot; (owner, 7 Oct 2026): the text stays in one column on the left

        top — the eyebrow keeps its own line above both. A content-sized track, 64 from the
        text. Below 1024 the actions fall back a stack under the lead. Stacked heads only; the
        link row on paper and on tint, then the longest heading and lead against it. An in-band

        A 4:5 photograph in 5 of [5, 7], radius 8, the copy in 7, 96 apart. Only one shape pins:
        blocks, then a footer. That copy column stretches to the photo and pins the footer to
        its bottom edge, so the two share a top and a bottom edge (§ 3.2 rule 1). Everything
        else is centred on the photo (rule 2): tiles with no footer, and a copy column with no
        blocks — a head and a footer, or a head and its actions — because there is nothing to
        fill a stretch and pinning would leave ~400 of empty column between the lead and the
        action. Head actions are never pinned; they sit a stack under the lead. The no-blocks
        bands are degrade cases, not page shapes (§ 3.4 B always carries tiles), and their foot
        takes rule=&#123;false&#125;: with no body above it, the hairline would underline the
        lead. The pinned band is shown beside the same band with media.pin=false, for the owner
        to choose between (spec open question 7). media.side flips the photo to the end. Below
        1024 the photo sits above the copy at 4:3. Tint rows are surface proof — on pages, tint
        is the proof band only (§ 1.7).

        counterweight has no phone form); in stacked, beside and a centred head it shows at
        every width, which these three bands prove at 390. Paper only, by type: beside any other
        surface the prop does not compile. Shown with a corner glow composed in place, in the
        bottom padding and leaving by the side. The media split&rsquo;s own counterweight is not
        this slot: it is media.counterweight, a field in the copy column

        The footer is the body&rsquo;s last row, a stack under the blocks, in every arrangement
        (sections 11 to 14 show it centred, beside, stacked and media). Stacked here, and beside
        with a footer and no blocks — a degrade case, not a page shape: a footer is not a
        trailing half on its own (a lone CtaRow level with the eyebrow over an empty two-thirds
        track), so the band is the stacked band, the footer a stack under the head. With no
        blocks the foot passes rule=&#123;false&#125;: its hairline marks where a body ends, and
        with no body above it, it would sit 48 under the lead as an underline.

        never the element. Shown centred and start-aligned. asideFill (beside, photo aside only)

        stretch to one height and the photo, a fit=&quot;fill&quot; Media, takes what the head
        text leaves, never below about 3:2. Without it (section 12) the 3:2 photo keeps its own
        height.
