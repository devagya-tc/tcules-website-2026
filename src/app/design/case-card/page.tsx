            featured cases. The 16:9 cover beside the eyebrow, claim and result on [7, 5], the
            cue pinned to the foot, on the boxed card&rsquo;s ground with a text mat. The shape
            approved as TestimonialCase (16 Oct 2026, round 7); the client&rsquo;s words left
            the card on 22 Oct 2026 (case study cards hold no testimonial), so the testimonials
            keep their own band.
