/**
 * Logo specimen — three heights, two bar treatments, four grounds.
 *
 * The claim this page has to actually show: the mark reads --logo-ink per surface, so one piece of
 * markup is correct on every surface. `mono` is the default and the chrome treatment — ch02 v1.0
 * makes the whole wordmark neutral-950 in UI chrome and white throughout on ink and on blue.
 * `accent` (the bar in brandeis-500) is shown only on paper and tint, because marketing scale on a
 * light ground is the only place the brand allows it; peridot is never in the wordmark.

              The Tcules wordmark, and specifically <strong>not</strong> an Icon. Both are
              filled, so the difference is not the paint: an icon is drawn on the
              system&rsquo;s own 24-unit box and takes <code>currentColor</code> entirely, while
              this is a logotype at its own aspect ratio, painted from its own tokens —
              <code>--logo-ink</code> for the whole mark, <code>--logo-bar</code> for the bar
              above the &ldquo;u&rdquo; in the accent variant — rather than inherited. Filing it
              as a glyph would have cost it both.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inline SVG rather than an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> for one reason: the mark reads
              tokens remapped per surface — neutral-950 on paper and tint, white throughout on
              ink and blue (ch02) — so it is correct on all four surfaces without four files. An SVG file cannot read a
              custom property from the page that embeds it.

Literals rather than gap-scale steps: a logotype's height is set so its x-height reads level with the chrome beside it, which is an optical measurement, not a distance between two things."
