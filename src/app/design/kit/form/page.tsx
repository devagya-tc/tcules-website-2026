/**
 * The form family (kit `cmp-form`): every composition the kit asks a form to sit in, laid out as
 * a showcase page — an intro band, then each variation as a titled band — rather than a dump.
 *
 * Every band is a real pattern composed with real props: a form sits only on CtaSection's island
 * (owner, 29 Oct 2026; decisions/2026-10-29-forms-only-on-the-island), so the one page band here is
 * that close; the rest are the form's own field sets and states. Showcase copy is inline (visual-direction § 8.4); photographs
 * come from the kit registry, one temperature family (warm + neutral, § 5.5).
 *
 * Posts go to the proving ground's own endpoint; `?outcome=` picks what it answers. The error-state
 * specimen's send answers 500 on purpose, which is the one console error the page logs.
