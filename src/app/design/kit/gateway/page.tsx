Each path is a small label (h5, sans) over its words (body-sm), then its services as flat graphic cards: the service’s own Sketch scene on its plate, the action’s authored words (h5-lg) under it, an arrow at the first line’s end; the whole card is the link, no box and no border. From 1024 words and cards are a split (1 : 2, 96 apart). From 768 the cards stand on three EQUAL tracks for both paths, so the two-service path leaves its third track empty. Below 768 each card is a row: the scene at 144 beside the words, the arrow trailing the last word. Hover a card: its arrow moves 4 (transform only)."
