 * Tag specimen — two variants, one size, one box, on all four surfaces.
 *
 * Three states deliberately have no props: hover, pressed and tab focus are the stylesheet's
 * business, driven by :hover, :active and :focus-visible. The spec's mockup printed them with a
 * `force` prop that exists only in a mockup and must never be implemented, so this page cannot
 * print them in a column — it says so where it matters rather than showing two states and calling
 * them five. Point at a chip, hold it down, and tab to it, on each of the four surfaces below.
 *
 * `selected` IS a real prop and is printed on every surface, because the held chip is the one
 * state this component's argument turns on: a REVERSED FILL on every surface — blue's model carried
 * to all four (tracker 2.17) — with the label and a `chrome-close` glyph turned to the opposite end.

BELOW, the same two labels in a Cluster as='ul': here the li is the flex item, and at the default min-width:auto it takes its minimum from the nowrap text inside it — so the ROW is pushed past the track instead of the box clipping. This row sits in a box that scrolls on its own, so the push is visible without the page scrolling sideways at 390. Compare the two.

            note="The empty case is the ordinary one: every chip but the held one passes no glyph. No reserved space, no placeholder box, no layout shift for the chips that never get one. The held chip beside it is 21px wider — 16 glyph (the counter floor, Icon.md), 4 gap, and the 1px label trim restored, because the trailing element is no longer a tracked capital."

The alternative is what would otherwise be here: a 24 × 24 empty box, and for the filter a focusable control with no accessible name. Returning null is the only handling that cannot ship a nameless target — so this tile is deliberately blank, and the blankness is the pass."

            note="The minimum is 24 in BOTH axes, so a one-character chip is a 24 × 24 square that meets SC 2.5.8 by size rather than by the spacing exception. There is no block padding to absorb, so on one line the minimum IS the height — 24, at every width, for both variants. Measure them."

The row below is at rowGap='tight' (8) — legal, and the reason the filter rows do not use it: a 24px target 8px from the next one is the case that made the row gap step up."

            note="Today’s selected filter on /insights is a ghost Button at --btn-height-sm 32 with extendHitArea. The chip beside it is 24. The filter rows get SHORTER when Tag lands, and that is the point: a tag is a mark in a row of text, not a control the height of a button. The cost is stated rather than hidden — 24 meets the AA target floor exactly, so the caller’s rowGap='text' is what keeps two targets apart, and no hit area is extended."
