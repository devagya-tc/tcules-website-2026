   *   - is silent: the status line speaks after a reader's own press, never after an advance;
   *   - STOPS when a reader presses a bar or a previous / next control (owner, 29 Oct 2026): what
   *     they chose stays, its bar full. Under `start` the rotation control then offers Play. A bar
   *     under KEYBOARD focus holds it for as long as focus stays;

 *
 * § 1.4 budgets the controls at 24 + 48 = 72 under the tallest slide (48 steppers since fix round 2,
 * cmp-testimonials, 6 Oct 2026); that is exactly this.
 *
 * The scrolling is the BROWSER'S: Layout's scroll mode is a CSS scroll-snap row, so before this
 * component hydrates — and if its script never runs — the row still swipes, snaps, and moves as Tab
 * reaches each linked slide. What the script adds is the two controls, the rail's position, a tab
 * stop when no slide holds anything focusable, and a polite status line. The controls render
 * `disabled` until then, so a press can never be swallowed by a button that does nothing.
 *
 * Accessibility (APG carousel, adapted to a scroll row):
 *   - the root is a `<section aria-roledescription="carousel">` named by `label`;
 *   - slides are list items — position and count come from the list, not from hand-written
 *     "1 of 6" labels that could disagree with it;
 *   - the controls are real `<button>`s named "Previous slide" / "Next slide", with
 *     `aria-controls` on the row (always rendered, so the idref always resolves). At an end a
 *     control is `aria-disabled`, not `disabled`: a disabled button drops focus to the body, and a
 *     keyboard user who pressed Next to the end would be thrown out of the carousel;
 *   - after a control press, a visually hidden `aria-live="polite"` line says which slides are in
 *     view ("Slides 4 to 6 of 8"). It speaks only after a press, never on load or while swiping;
 *   - no autoplay unless asked for (`autoplay`, one per view): then a rotation control leads the
 *     controls, the rotation holds under the pointer and focus on the slides, and never starts for a
 *     reader who prefers reduced motion;
 *   - reduced motion: the row jumps instead of gliding (Layout's `scroll-behavior` is smooth only
 *     under `no-preference`, and the press uses the row's computed behaviour), and the controls'
 *     fill change is instant.
 *
 * A pattern for the usual two reasons: it takes slides as content and composes Layout, Cluster and
 * Icon. It owns no band and no ground; it sits in a band's body (ContentSection's children) and
 * reads data-surface from that Section. A client component because it holds state, a ref and
 * listeners — the only reasons `'use client'` is earned here.

     WCAG 2.2.2 (Pause, Stop, Hide) without a rotation button, for the centred row: pressing any bar
     STOPS the rotation on that slide (owner, 29 Oct 2026); a bar under keyboard focus, like the
     slides under a mouse or focus, HOLDS it for as long as it stays.
     A mouse press also focuses the bar in some browsers, so only :focus-visible counts as a hold
     here — otherwise a clicked bar would hold the rotation until the reader clicked elsewhere. So
     every reader who can reach the content has a way to stop it, at the control they would use
     anyway, and nothing rotates at all under prefers-reduced-motion. A 48 pause circle in the
     middle of a centred quote would be the loudest thing in the band, for a job the bars already do. */
