   same fill, the same rule, a placeholder a step apart. An emphasis nobody can see is worse than

   * rule and no ring: the field sits inside a container the COMPOSING pattern draws (a message
   * composer), and that container owns the focus indicator (`:focus-within`). Never use `bare`
   * outside such a container: on its own it has no visible focus.
   *

   * focus lifts it to the brighter step and draws the focus rule, invalid draws the danger rule.
