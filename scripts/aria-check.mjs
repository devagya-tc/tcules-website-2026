/**
 * Assert that every ARIA idref in the RENDERED output points at an element that exists.
 *
 * This is the one defect class in this repo that survives every other check. A rehearsal build of
 * a spec'd component shipped 95 dangling `aria-controls` on one specimen page — the panel was
 * conditionally rendered, the attribute was not — and `lint`, `typecheck`, `tokens:check` and
 * `next build` were all clean. A broken ARIA graph is invisible to a type system (the attribute
 * takes any string), invisible to a grep (the id is computed), and invisible in a browser unless
 * you are driving a screen reader.
 *
 * `SiteNav` already answers it correctly and is the precedent to copy:
 *
 *     aria-controls={isOpen ? panelId(item.key) : undefined}
 *
 * The attribute exists only while its target does. Pointing an idref at an element that is not in
 * the DOM is worse than omitting it: a screen reader announces a relationship and then finds
 * nothing at the other end of it.
 *
 * Reads the prerendered HTML under .next/server/app, so it needs a build first:
 *
 *     npm run build && npm run aria:check
 *
 * Deliberately NOT part of `npm run verify` — verify must stay fast and build-free. Run it before
 * shipping anything interactive.
