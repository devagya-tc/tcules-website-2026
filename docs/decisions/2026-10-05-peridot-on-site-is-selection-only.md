Peridot on the site is `::selection` only (and the carried item inside illustrations). The "marked phrase" band is a social-media device; the website does not highlight text.

**Why.** Peridot does not work as a UI colour.

**The mistake it prevents.** A marked-phrase highlight in a website heading.

**How to apply.** `globals.css` `::selection`. ch02 §4 lists the marked phrase as one of peridot's two uses without limiting it to social.
