A split-section image keeps a fixed ratio (e.g. 4:5 or 3:2) at its own size. It never stretches to fill the section height (`block-size: 100%` or fill).

**Why.** Stretching to the copy's height loses control of the crop.

**The mistake it prevents.** Split images sized by the copy column beside them.

**How to apply.** Any media in a split. ch05 §9 lists placements but not this split rule.
